            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The ſecond ſort of men, from whom I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect a Cenſorious Vote, are the greateſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Officers, Clerks, and Practiſers of the <hi>Law,</hi> (who indeed by their ſuperſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, alterations, innovations, additions, and other devices, have ſubverted the practice of the <hi>Law,</hi> and ſet another face upon it:) Theſe
<pb facs="tcp:106682:5"/> will tell me, That by this Craft we have our wealth, as <hi>Demetrius</hi> told his fellows, when DIANA, as he thought, was in danger. They are come into the rooms and places of the Popiſh Clergie, as they were called, who anciently were the Clerks and Officers in the Courts at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>
               <note n="c" place="margin">Theſe Clerks uſed to make all Convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, and wrote the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gice-books. <hi>14</hi> H. <hi>8. 8.</hi>

And theſe are ſworn, and reſolved to all their old courſes, tending to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit: And therefore, if they conſult about this matter, they will conclude, That many things may be amended; as they found at their laſt Meeting in <hi>Staple</hi>-Inne-hall: but heed muſt be taken, that nothing be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted againſt, which tends to the Practiſers or Clerks profit. And I ſhall very likely hear them ſay of me, as I heard ſome of them ſpeak of one of the moſt conſiderable of the late Reformers of the Law, that he was like the Fox in the Fable, which would have all other Foxes Tails cut off, becauſe he had none of his own. But to ſuch of theſe as are reſolved ſtill to make ſilver-ſhrines for
<pb facs="tcp:106682:6"/> DIANA, and to prefer theſe our laws, before the Laws of God; I'll ſay no more but this:<note n="d" place="margin">Rev. 22.11.</note> 
               <hi>He that is unjuſt, let him be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt;</hi> and, <hi>He that is filthy, let him be filthy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the reſt of them, of whom I have more hope, that they have ſomething of the knowledge of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> I ſhall onely commend that Motto, which I once ſaw ſet up in a Lawyers Study, <hi>Non quid, ſed Quomodo:</hi> If this were well conſidered, that a little well gotten, with the Bleſſing of God upon it, would be better then great treaſures of Iniquity; and that the good of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is to be preferred before private pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit: This, I ſay, would make men willing to have a happy reformation; which cannot be had, until we be fit for it.</p>
            <p>For that which may be caſt upon my ſelf, I do aver,<note place="margin">Moſt men are like <hi>Tiberius</hi> the Roman Emperor, who ſaid, that his time was no time for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. <hi>Tac. Annal. l. 2. c. 8. p. 43</hi>
               </note> That I have had my ſhare of advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage by the laws, equal to moſt of my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in the Countrey where I live: But I do profeſs that now, after almoſt thirty years practice, I finde the laws in divers par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of Common Right, and Puniſhment of ſome Offences, more uncertain, unequal,
<pb facs="tcp:106682:6"/> perplexed, and repugnant to the Laws of God, and burthenſome to the people, then any Laws either of Heathens or Chriſtians, that ever I read or heard of; and theſe make theſe Laws cry out for Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>The third ſort whoſe Cenſure I muſt look to undergo, are the great Props and Supporters of this Law, who will tell the world, with Sir <hi>Edward Coke,</hi> That no one yet ever cenſured or controlled <hi>Littleton</hi> (the Common Law) but he that underſtood him not.</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, That I do not cenſure <hi>Littleton,</hi> more then Gods Word cenſures him: <hi>There is one that accuſeth</hi> (him and) <hi>you, even</hi>

               <hi>Moſes and the Prophets:</hi> If <hi>Littleton,</hi> or any other Oracle, ſpeak not according to theſe, whether their Laws concern faith or manners, <hi>it is becauſe there is no light in them.</hi> But I have much hope of many of the Judges
<pb facs="tcp:106682:7"/> and great men of the land, that they will lay their hands to the Work of Reformation, to the honour of God (who hath honoured them) and for the good and benefit of the people; foraſmuch as they cannot but be very ſenſible of the great evils which attend the Laws, as now they ſtand, being repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the Laws of God, as many Judges<note n="g" place="margin">Sir <hi>George Crook,</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant <hi>Parker,</hi> Juſtice <hi>Ask,</hi> about Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaughter, at <hi>W.</hi> and <hi>Co.</hi> Sir <hi>George Crook</hi> about Witchcraft exerciſed, where death followed not, at <hi>Cov.</hi>
               </note> have hinted upon the Bench in ſeveral Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. And this is all I ſhall ſay in anſwer to mine accuſers.</p>
            <p>One thing more I do affirm, That, to my knowledge, I have not in this Treatiſe wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly charged any thing as a fault upon the Law, either in the exceſs or defect, in the Theory or Practiſe, but what I have found therein, and proved the ſame to be repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the Rules and Conſequences of the holy Scriptures, contained in the Old and New Teſtament: And for ſuch things as are any whit queſtionable, whether the law be ſo or no, I have uſually there quoted the Authorities of the law for proof thereof, and
<pb facs="tcp:106682:7"/> put down the Scriptures as their Oppoſites, for their correction, and in confirmation of mine own Aſſertions: But where (in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of daily practiſe, every Clerk or Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney can be my witneſs) I have alledged any thing, (as about ſuing to the Exigent, Tryal of Priſoners, Returns of Writs, and the like) and have not cited any Books or Rolls for proof thereof, I did it purpoſely, becauſe I held it needleſs, being conſtantly and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly done every <hi>Term.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now to draw to an end, leſt the Gate ſhould prove too big for the Building, I do profeſs, that I am not ſo confidently igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, as to imagine, that all that I have here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in written, ought to paſs for currant with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out controll (having to deal upon ſuch an uncertain ſubject as the law, wherein Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> himſelf is cenſured for groſs Miſtakes) but rather, that through ignorance and other infirmities, I may erre and wander in many things, having gone an untrodden way, without a Guide, or any one to go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me; there being not one Book, to my knowledge, extant of this kinde. If what I have done, ſhall but prevail ſo far, as to
<pb facs="tcp:106682:8"/> ſtir up any more wiſe and learned to take this matter in hand, and ſhew us a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent way, I have my reward.

And if the Theory be thus neceſſarily altered, and another face put upon it, and the Practick part more changed and corrupted (as ſhall appear in this Treatiſe) then muſt it be concluded, that the Law which now we have in uſe, is not the ancient Law of the land; nor that the ſame Law neither was nor is ſo perfect and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, as it hath been commonly affirmed to be: But that the Law, as now it ſtands in uſe and practice, is a new pompous Edifice, erected upon ſome old Foundation, and become an Engine to draw wealth to the great Officers, Profeſſors and Practicers thereof, to the impoveriſhing of the reſidue of the Subjects; not having any Foundation either in the Law of Nature, or on the Poſitive Laws of God, ſufficient to bear up the ſame; and therefore can deſerve no ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, or be held ſo ſacred, as that it ought not, or may not, upon good ground, be altered and amended, and the Prolixities, Uncertainties, Difficulties and Extravagancies thereof reformed.

               <p>Upon theſe grounds it may be cleared, That we are much departed from the Law of God, and have received a Law from Antichriſt: and it will further appear in the particulars following, That many wicked and profane Incroachments are made by our Laws upon the honour of God, in abuſe of

And the Defendant pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth his Bill into the Chancery; and therein alledgeth all that is true, and ſomewhat more, to make his Bill hold: and if the Plaintiff at Law get Judgement entred, before the Bill come in, (which may be had the firſt week in the next Term after the Tryal) there is an end of the Suit; the poor man hath had Juſtice, <hi>Summum Jus,</hi> that is, the extremity of the Law, which is <hi>Summa Injuria;</hi> and his Adverſary hath Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution againſt him for the Twenty pounds Penalty, and Eight pounds for Coſts, which is given in nature of damages: This he Defendant muſt pay, or lie in Goal; and the Law, as it is Juſtice (in conceit) cannot relieve him. Well, the poor man hath (it may be) got a Reprive, upon preferring his Bill; the Plaintiff at Law is either in Contempt, or prayes a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dimus Poteſtatem,</hi> to anſwer in the Countrey; or it may be in his Anſwer, confeſſeth part of the Money paid, or elſe that the Bond is ancient. Hereupon, the Complaint in Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:106682:30"/> obtaineth an Injunction, and in ſhort goes to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and brings the Cauſe to Hearing, and hath a Decree, That the Plaintiff paying the Intereſt (which may be ſome thirty ſhillings) and Coſts (which may be five Marks) beſides the aforeſaid Eight pounds, the Defendant, who was Plaintiff at Law, ſhall acknowledge ſatisfaction of the Judgement, and deliver up the Bond. The Decree is inrolled, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant ſerved with a Writ of Execution of it, and obeys it: and this is the beſt that can be expected. And then the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties fall to caſt up their Accompts; and it's found, That the Plaintiff at Law ſpent Eight pounds, and the Defendant four pounds: The Plaintiff in Chancery ſpent Twenty pounds, and the Defendant Twenty Marks: Lay all this together, and in concluſion, the Debtor hath ſpent 24 <hi>l.</hi> and paid 11 <hi>l.</hi> 6 <hi>s.</hi> 8 <hi>d.</hi> and the Creditor hath ſpent 21 <hi>l.</hi> 6 <hi>s.</hi> 8 <hi>d.</hi> and received for his Debt and Coſts 11 <hi>l.</hi> 6 <hi>s.</hi> 8 <hi>d.</hi> So the Creditor loſeth his Debt, and Ten pounds out of his purſe; and the Debtor hath ſpent and paid 35 <hi>l.</hi> 6 <hi>s.</hi> 8 <hi>d.</hi> where the firſt Debt was but Ten pounds, and the Remainder was but thirty ſhillings. O famous Law and Equity! I could ſhew many of theſe Caſes: And indeed, this hath been the common practice with moſt Judges, to ſend men to Equity: and they ought to do ſo, whileſt the Law ſtands as it doth. Now apply this to the Rule and Argument above-mentioned: The Law could not relieve the Debtor, but Equity doth relieve him; Which of theſe two hath done him Right? The Law did him none; for if it had done him Right, then the Chancery ought not to have done the contrary; which it hath done: for, to charge a man, and to diſcharge him, are clean contrary. And the Chancery hath not relieved him; for in effect, he hath paid and ſpent more then treble the principal Debt and Intereſt: So upon the point, he is relieved no-where: And yet every man will ſay, He is no juſt man, who refuſeth to deliver up a Bond when it's fully paid. How doth this Law (put all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether) give every man Right? and if it do not, then is it an unjuſt Law. I do confidently affirm, That no Nation pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing the Goſpel, ought to have or maintain any Law ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere or rigid, that it needs any Court of Equity to moderate it. If it were needful or convenient in any caſe, to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:106682:30"/> in Equity, it muſt needs be in caſe of Life and Death, which is a buſineſs of higher Concernment then a little Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and more favoured in Law. But no man ever heard of a Bill preferred into any Court of Equity, to ſave one from the Gallows; and therefore it is to be preſumed, there is no need of any ſuch Court, if the Law were Juſt and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual.</p>
               <p>But becauſe it may be every man will not be ſatisfied, that in the Caſe above-mentioned, there was a direct Repugnancy in the Judgements of theſe two Courts; becauſe, The Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery did give relief <hi>in Tanto,</hi> though not <hi>in Toto:</hi> I'll onely put one ſhort Caſe more, to put the matter out of que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.</p>
               <p>A man indebted upon a ſingle Bill, payes the Money upon the day in the Bill appointed, and hath Witneſs of the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but the Bill cannot be found: This Bill comes after to be put in Suit; the Defendant cannot be admitted to plead payment at the day, nor hath he any other Plea ſufficient in Law to diſcharge himſelf; nor can be relieved at Law, unleſs he have a Releaſe, although he prove the Debt paid; but Judgement muſt needs paſs againſt him, either by Default, or Confeſſion, or upon a Verdict, after Iſſue joyned upon ſome falſe Plea, which the Defendant thinks moſt eaſie, and after which he ſhall have moſt colour of Equity. Well, Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is paſſed, and the Defendant muſt expect Execution, without relief at Law. But for fear of the worſt, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant hath before Judgement his Bill preferred into the Chancery, to which the Defendant, Plaintiff at Law, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and the Cauſe comes to hearing; where it appears, the Debt to be paid: thereupon, the Court decrees the Bill to be delivered up. Here is a juſt Contradiction, and diametri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Oppoſition: The Law condemns the Debtor, or at leaſt will not relieve him; and the Chancery doth diſcharge him of the debt, and ſo relieves him. Upon this conſideration, ſome honeſt Judges of late dayes, have uſed in ſome Caſes, to order the Plaintiff (upon the Defendants payment of the principal Debt, with Intereſt, and Coſts, or what ſhall appear to be unpaid) to deliver up the Specialty, and diſcontinue the Suit, or ſtay the ſame. This is a ſhort and equal way (which is
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:106682:31"/> Juſtice, and no more) to give every one his Right, according to that of the wiſe Heathen,<note n="(n)" place="margin">

               <p>THat which in the former Chapter is ſaid, concerning a Debtor having relief onely in Equity, againſt the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty of a Bond, or in an Action brought upon a ſingle Bill, which is paid (being things moſt common in every mans pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice) I have therein ſufficiently anſwered, and cleared it, That the Judges of Law might eaſily deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine all ſuch Cauſes without a Court of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,<note place="margin">The Court of Chancery was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently <hi>Officina Juſtitiae,</hi> and the Lord Chancellor uſed to ſit as Chief Juſtice of the Common Pleas; and no mention made of a Court of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, until the Reign of <hi>H 6. and Ed. 4.</hi> Coke <hi>Inſt. 2 part. p. 552</hi>
                  </note> by ordering the Plaintiff to take and accept what is due upon the Bond, or any Specialty wherein there is a Penalty; and by admitting the Defendant to plead payment at the day to a ſingle Bill. And where Money is not paid at the day, to allow Damages for the time, according to the Plaintiffs loſs: So joyning Law and Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty together, to make up perfect Juſtice; and that is all which needs in ſuch caſes.</p>
               <p>Thoſe things which are moſt ſtood upon, for upholding of theſe two Courts, or Diſtinct Powers and Juriſdictions, are ſuch as theſe following.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 1. Firſt, it's ſaid, That in caſes of Mortgages for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:106682:32"/> there is no remedy at the Common Law,<note n="a" place="margin">

Luk. 6.31.</note> but the Mortgager muſt loſe his Land, fot how little ſoever it be Mortgaged, without any relief elſwhere, but in Equity: And therefore this being a matter of great Concernment, ought to be remedied in a Court of Equity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. If it be remembred what is ſaid before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Bonds, and other Specialties with Penalties, that partly anſwereth this Objection: for in an Action of Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs and Ejectment, if the Defendant might have liberty up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the general Iſſue pleaded, to give in Evidence what the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Debt was, for which the Lands were Mortgaged, and what Profits have been taken by the Mortgagees; the Debt and Damages for the Money may ſuddenly be computed or found by a Jury. And if the Judges in ſuch caſe, as in caſe of a forfeited Bond, enforce the Mortgagee (or his Heir, in caſe he bring the Action) to accept the ſame principal Debt and Damages, with reaſonable Coſts (if he did not formerly refuſe it) without more ado, and releaſe or aſſign the Mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage; which might be eaſily done, with a little Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Law: What uſe were there of a Court of Equity?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 2. The like may be ſaid concerning Covenants or Conditions broken in other caſes: where a man Covenants to pay Rent or make repairs, or hath an Eſtate with a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſo, or ſubject to a Condition of Re-entry for non-payment of Money;<note n="(b)" place="margin">This extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of rigour is the worſt Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion in the Commonwealth &amp; a tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Gods Law, <hi>Iſa. 58.6.

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> In theſe caſes, the courſe above-mentioned is a ſufficient Remedy to finde out the Damage ſuſtained by the non-performance of the Covenant: which may be as well done, with a little Alteration, in an Action of Debt upon the Bond, as upon an Action of Covenant, which is ordinarily in uſe; and in caſe of a Condition broken, to aſcertain the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, and appoint the Plaintiff to accept thereof, as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> This Caſe grows remedileſs, partly by the diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Biſhops or Eccleſiaſtical Courts (as they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led) and may eaſily be remedied, if the Law were a little al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered: For what reaſon can be given, that an Action of Debt may not as well lie for a Legacy, as for any other Duty pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as Executor or Adminiſtrator? It's true, that at the Common Law, generally mens Perſonal Eſtates were at the mercy of the Biſhops or Prieſts, to diſpoſe the ſame for the health and ſalvation of mens Souls, as was pretended: but now we are freed from that thraldome, it were fit, that every mans Eſtate ſhould perform his Will, according to the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors Oath, by paying Legacies (as well as Debts) in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place, as far as the Teſtators Eſtate will extend; and that an Action of Debt lay for it as aforeſaid: for that if a man ſue in Equity for a Legacy of Twenty pounds, or under, he ſhall ſpend it every peny in Suit, if he have not a very eaſie Adverſary.</p>

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> This is a fault in the Law, that a man can have no means to enforce one to perform his Covenant: But this might eaſily be amended, either by putting the Covenant in Iſſue upon a Traverſe, or by deviſing an Iſſue, as is uſually done by Order of the Chancery; and if it be found, that the Defendant Covenanted or Agreed under his Hand and Seal, as the Plaintiff alledgeth, Why might not the Judgement be, That the Defendant ſhall perform his Agreement, and pay Damages, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as well as in a <hi>Replevin,</hi> that the Cattel ſhall be returned, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or in an Action of Debt, that a

The reaſon of it is, (although it need none to confirm it; for it is alſo a Maxime, <hi>Contra Negantem Principia non eſt diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tandum</hi>) becauſe every man is neareſt to himſelf; and it's againſt Nature, for him to be a means of his own puniſhment: a man ought to preſerve himſelf, although to the hurt of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other: it were better to kill another, then to kill himſelf, or to ſuffer himſelf to be killed; if of neceſſity the one muſt needs be. Therefore, to exact this Inquiſitory Oath againſt a mans ownſelf, is againſt the Law of Nature, and ſo againſt the Law of God. This is the very ſame Oath which was brought into <hi>England</hi> by Pope <hi>Martin</hi> the fifth, for extirpation of the followers of <hi>John Wickliff,</hi> called <hi>Lollards,</hi> about the Reign of King <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. and was taken up by the Eccleſiaſtical Courts (as they were called) I ſuppoſe, long before it was uſed in any Engliſh Court; and afterwards, it was moſt famouſly uſed in the Star-Chamber, and in the High-Commiſſion, called The Oath <hi>Ex Officio;</hi> the Defendants being, beſides their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, examined upon Interrogatories; as ſometimes they are in other Courts.

He was anſwered, There was no more deſired of him. Thereupon, the honeſt Gentleman (although a Lawyer) was deluded and cozened with this word <hi>Law;</hi> which was equivocal, either referring to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law, or to their Popiſh Tyrannical Canon or Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Law: and taking his Oath, had Queſtions demanded of him, of things which intrenched upon his Eſtate and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, (for which he might be fined and impriſoned) if not his life. To theſe he anſwered, That he was not bounden by Law to anſwer to them, being againſt himſelf; according to
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:106682:34"/> that Rule of Right Reaſon above mentioned: <hi>No man is bound to accuſe himſelf.</hi> This they declared Perjury; and for that they fined him 300 <hi>l.</hi> What difference is there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe proceedings, and the proceedings in Courts of Equity, eſpecially when Anſwers are made to Exceptions, or when the party is examined upon Interrogatories againſt himſelf? The beſt that can be made of it, is, That it is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faning the holy Name of God, and the abuſe of an Oath; as being here, not<note n="(g)" place="margin">Heb. 6.16.</note> 
                  <hi>the end,</hi> but the beginning, or rather occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſtrife: and if this Oath were taken away, men would be ſure to have Witneſſes preſent to all their Contracts and Agreements. And it may be obſerved, that there is no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of credit given to the Defendants Anſwer: for the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſers in Chancery uſe to ſay, <hi>It's no matter if the Defendant ſwear the Crow is white, if the Plaintiff can prove ſhe is black.</hi> And upon this ground all wiſe men proceed, in reference to Suits in Courts of Equity; not to prefer their Bill, unleſs they can prove it, or at leaſt the material points thereof. I have obſerved, That in almoſt thirty years practice, I never found one Defendant, who wanted conſcience to pay a juſt Debt, (where it could not be proved by Witneſſes) that would ever confeſs it in an Anſwer upon his Oath; but rather uſe the help of ſome skilful man, to draw his Anſwer ſo equivocal, or cautelouſly, that it might not prejudice his Cauſe. This hath been, and is a heavie temptation and provocation to Perjury, and ſo a breach of the Law of God: which cauſeth the Land to mourn, and therefore ought to be aboliſhed.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It may be anſwered, firſt, That all Frauds and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts are things criminal <hi>in foro Conſcientiae,</hi> and for which in moſt Caſes a man may be indicted at Common Law; and, in ſome Caſes, by vertue of ſeveral Statutes; as, for fraudulent Conveyances, and for ſome deceipts in Bargaining, and for cozenage in ſelling of Wares, and in many other Caſes. And if a man in any caſe were to be enforced to confeſs the truth
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:106682:35"/> againſt himſelf, there is moſt reaſon it ſhould be done in Criminal Cauſes moſt capital; as, when Treaſon, Adultery, Murder, or ſome great Felony is committed, and ſeveral men accuſed, Were it not a fair pretence, that every man, to clear himſelf, and to the end to finde out the Truth, ſhould be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined upon his Oath? And yet this is not allowed in the Law, nor ought to be done, for the reaſon aforeſaid; unleſs the Defendant will<note n="(i)" place="margin">Exo. 22.11</note> voluntarily offer his Oath: which may be admitted by the Law of God, otherwiſe <hi>Joſhua</hi>
                  <note n="(k)" place="margin">Joſh. 7.19, 22.</note> would not have done it in the caſe of <hi>Achan:</hi> although he exhorted him to confeſs the truth, and give glory to God; yet he did not enforce him to ſwear, but ſearched his tent for the wedge of gold and the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> garment: neither did our Lord Jeſus Chriſt urge the woman taken in adultery to accuſe her ſelf, but asked where her accuſers were;<note place="margin">Joh. 8.10, 11.</note> and when he ſaw that no witneſſes accuſed her, he ſaid, No more do I; and bid her go her ways, and ſin no more.</p>
               <p>Now in thoſe Caſes which are not criminal, as about Truſts, and Eſtates in Land in Extent, and ſuch-like, which may uſually be proved by Witneſſes, where men are forced to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer upon Oath; theſe do many times intrench more upon mens Liberty and Eſtates, in reſpect of conſequence, then an hundred trivial Frauds or Thefts: and therefore this will not warrant their anſwering upon Oath.

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:106682:61"/> may be alſo gathered by the computation of the Rent-Corn reſerved upon the Colledge-leaſe, made in purſuit of the Statute of the 18th. of <hi>Eliz.</hi> where the third part reſerved in Corn, (if I miſtake not) doth much exceed the other two thirds in money. Lay all this together, and it muſt needs be granted that forty ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, when the Statute of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> was made, was as much in value as forty pounds was fourteen years ſince. I do not ſpeak of the values, as things now are, becauſe Corn and Cattle are fallen half in half from their uſual prices; (but Almighty God can alter thoſe things in an ordinary courſe of providence, when he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth) in the mean while we are to bleſſe God for our plenty, which never was conceived to be a Plague, or a Judgement, but a token of great proſperity, and muſt needs be ſo at this day, if Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney and Lands were rated anſwerably.

               <p>Now out of this grand miſchief, many other evils grow, and are nouriſhed thereby.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Expences occaſioned by Suites at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> are ſix times more than they need be, whereof the greater part is uſually ſpent in Horſ-meat and Manſ-meat.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:106682:62"/>2. Travelling to <hi>London</hi> conſtantly occaſioned by theſe Suites from Term to Term, much weareth out mens ſpirits, and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth their bodies, eſpecially if the journey be long and tedious, beſides the loſſe of time, which might be ſpent more profitably at home.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The deſtruction of Horſes, which have pined ſtarted, &amp; ſpoiled in and about <hi>London,</hi> is by eſtimation as much loſſe and charge yearly to the Common-wealth, as the payment of a Subſidy in former times, which was above one hundred thouſand pounds, that is above ten pounds for every Pariſh, one with another.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The concourſe of people of all ſorts, from all parts to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> cauſeth a great increaſe of wickedneſſe, and is the Nurſe of all Rebellion and Commotion, by reaſon that <hi>London</hi> being as a Wood to ſhelter all men, as well ſuch as having run out of their Eſtates live there unknown, as all others, who live by their wits, or have committed any villanies, or have any deſign to plot, or contrive miſchief, uſually reſort thither; where by reaſon of the multitude, and ſo many ſtrangers unknown, no account can be taken of their Actions, or manner of living, the common pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence being their attendance upon one Court, or other, which occaſioneth Impunity, and lets looſe the Rains to all Iniquity.</p>
               <p n="5">5. This hurrying up to <hi>London,</hi> eſpecially by the Nobility and Gentry, cauſeth nothing but profuſeneſſe, and ill husbandry, where for the moſt part they learn nothing, but drinking, drab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing, and fantaſtical faſhions, and in the mean while their houſes in the Countreys ſtand vacant, as a Lodge whom none inhabits but a ſingle keeper, and their poor Tenants want work and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Upon this occaſion the whole conſiderable trade of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (except of ſome few Sea-Towns) is carried up to <hi>London,</hi> &amp; generally all other Cities and Towns are decayed, and almoſt ruined and impoveriſhed.<note n="(h)" place="margin">This cau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſeth thoſe two plagues of a Common-wealth, Riches and Povertie, when ſome have too much and others too ltitle, which makes the Rich tyranize over the poor, and more to regard their pleaſure and exceſſe in dyet and Apparell than vertue and godlineſſe. And the poor becauſe they ſee themſelves miſerable and troden under foot, to envy the rich, and become deſperate. <hi>Bodm. Republ. l. 5. cap. 2. pag. 569. Ex Platone.</hi>
                  </note> And this muſt needs be that <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio unius est Corruptio alterius,</hi> as when the head is nouriſhed to an unuſual greatneſſe (as in caſe of the Rickets) then all the body grows lean, although the over-growing of the head is but
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:106682:62"/> a corrupt, or excrementions increaſe. And it is to be believed that the ballaſting of the trade of the Nation would much tend to the health, and good of the whole. For if <hi>London</hi> (which now furniſheth all the Nobility, Gentry, and people of Eſtates and quality, through all <hi>England,</hi> and a great part of <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> with their Apparel, Linens, Spices, and all neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and curioſities) ſold the ſame to the Tradeſ-men and Chapmen in the Countreys, this would inrich the whole Nation; and <hi>London,</hi> for the better part of it, would rather get than loſe by it, for then they would have a certain trade, with ſuch as (having trading in the Countrey anſwerable to the ſtock they keep in Trade) would grow rich, and be able to pay their Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors at <hi>London,</hi> whereas now hardly one Tradeſ-man in a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-Town, and very few in Cities and great places get any Eſtates, and many when they dye leave not ſufficient to pay their debts: And on the other ſide, the moſt part of the Retaylers in <hi>London</hi> deal in the Countreys with the Gentry and others, and the Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, who commonly run the greateſt hazard, becauſe he that will gain greatly muſt adventure deſperately, by reaſon of long payment, and loſſe of debts, become ruined and deſtroyed in their Eſtates, by truſting of ſtrangers far and near, whereas if the Trade were more mediate, and went through the hands of the Tradeſmen in the Countrey, as it would be more certain to the <hi>Londoner,</hi> ſo the Countrey Tradeſman would be better able to furniſh himſelf; and by this means leſſe loſſe would be in debts, when the Countrey-man truſts his neighbours with that he knows men are able to pay, and the Commodity ſold might be afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the ſecond hand as cheap as it's ſold in <hi>London,</hi> in regard of the Charge, Rent, and houſe-keeping, which admits a great abatement in the Countrey of what is ſpent and paid in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. The laſt thing which ſhall be mentioned touching this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and which is moſt ſuitable to the propounded end of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe in hand, is, that this carrying of all cauſes to <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> makes in a manner all the Courts of Record, in all other Cities &amp; Towns Corporate, with the County Courts, Hundred Courts, and the Courts of the Mannours, and all other Court Barons to be diſuſed and in a manner deſtroyed, to the prejudice both of Lords and Tenants, who are much impoveriſhed with Suites at

                  <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> upon every trivial occaſion, and in the mean while there is much diſorder at home for want of Courts to redreſſe petty wrongs, and ſo to keep and preſerve quietneſſe.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Theſe things are enumerated as evils occaſioned by the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Reſidence of the Laws at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> without reference to the particular Courts; now ſomething ſhall be ſpoken of in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the ſeveral Courts, which are neceſſitouſly oppreſſive to the Suiters, in regard of the multitudes of Suites: The chief grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance in this kinde is, the crowding of all cauſes of Equity into Court of Chancery (except a very few in ſome caſes in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer) in which Court there have been ſaid to be ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand cauſes entred into the ſix Clarks books, ſome of which are ſeven, eight, or ten years old, and without doubt there are as many more upon <hi>Sub-poena's,</hi> and Bills not fil'd, of all theſe there cannot be leſſe than one thouſand alwayes ready for hearing (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides ſuch as ſtand to be heard upon Reviews, Pleas, Demurrers, Exceptions and Reports.)

The Major of this Propoſition is the Scripture it ſelf, all things, <hi>i. e.</hi> all Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:106682:68"/> things are ſanctified by the word of God and prayer, the Minor is undeniable, there being no word of God to vvarrant ſuch a courſe of getting, and what man upon any ground of Scripture, or word of faith, can, or dare go to God, and pray that he may win: Now whatſoever is not of faith is ſin, therefore the conſ quence is clear, that ſuch Gaming for money is unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, beſides every Lawfull means of getting may be made a trade, or profeſſion to live by, but no man will be ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent as to ſay that Gaming may be made a trade to live by, all that can be ſaid, is, that it is but recreation, and no man living can juſtifie to ſpend all his life in play, recreation, for God hath ordained that men ſhould have Lawfull callings, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in them, and therein exerciſe themſelves with pains and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, that every man ſhould eat his bread in the ſweat of his face, which by a <hi>Metonymis</hi> of the <hi>Adjunct,</hi> (or rather of the effect) ſignifieth that he ſhould labour in ſome Lawfull calling: <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradiſe was not exempted from this, and upon this ground the lives of all Vagrants, and ſuch as follow no Lawfull calling are condemned.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And further, God never ordained Gaming to be a means to transfer Eſtates from one to another, but hath ordained, buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſelling, giving, exchanging, earning by labour, merchandize, ſearching into the ſecrets of nature, for improving of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and ſuch like, to, and for that uſe and end, to the upholding of humane ſociety and commerce, that men in a Common-wealth might be helpfull one to another: But where men either get, or looſe by ſuch unwarrantable courſes which God never ordained, they may expect the curſe of God, and not his bleſſing.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Laſtly, there are as many miſchiefs, and abominations follow this courſe of Gaming, and the iſſue is commonly as accurſed, as of any wickedneſſe which men commit, what curſing, ſwearing, quarreling, fighting, cheating, thieving, and murders are oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by this practice, eſpecially when men looſe their monies: The concluſion and <hi>Cataſtrophe,</hi> for the moſt part to all great Gameſters, is beggery, the Goal, or the Gallowes, their Wives, Children, and Families ruined, and deſtroyed by this means, and yet no Law againſt it, being uſed in private houſes.</p>

And it may be judged that the Miniſters are blinded with the profits of the Tythes, more than they were with their ſignificant Garments and ceremonies, becauſe they receive more worldly advantage by them than by the reſt, which being unprofitable they have more willingly parted withall: And eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially their Pariſhes which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> received from the Heathen (the City of <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf being, before the Suburbs were built, or the Citie ſacked by the Goaths and Vandals) divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two and thirty Pariſhes, and ſo came into the hands of the Pope, who ſucceeded the <hi>Pontifex Maximus</hi> of the Heathen, with payment of Tythes, like thoſe of the Jews, as before is here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſet forth; and thence came all this traſh into <hi>England</hi> with
